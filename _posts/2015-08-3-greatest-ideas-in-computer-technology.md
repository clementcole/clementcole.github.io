In this post I will talk about some of the greatest ideas in computer hardware technology.



					## Moore's Law

  Moore''s law states that the size of transistors will approximately halved every 18 months, this will in effect increase the performance
of computing technology to twice it''s previous performance, because now more transistors can fit into a single core processor, hence 
more throughput in terms of computer performance. Note that if transportation technologies had kept up with the pace of that of computers, 
by now we could travel back and forth from New York to London in just under a penny. Ideally, the cost of transportation will be a whole
cheaper than the current trend :p. 

  There''s been several revolution prior to computing technology but none has kept up with the same accelerated pace as that of information
technology. There was the agricultural revolution, industrial revolution(which actually paved way to computers), also don''t forget the technology 
revolution. Then somewhere around the 1960''s came the digital revolution and where Moore''s Law is more evident. However, with the latest trend, we 
have the information revolution which has absorbed all levels of abstraction to enable unique designs in communications and several other algorithm 
implementations. Currently, the processing performance of super computers once dedicated to large government agencies is now available in disposable cellphones 
and tablets or even a teenager''s ipod. Lets not also forget that today''s technological advancement has also played an important role in the level 
of pollution. Due to the fact people can pass on information through long distances without the need for transportation :p.


				## Advancement in Human Genome

  HGP still remains one of the greatest feats of exploration in history to understand our biological makeup as species dwelling on a planet as
part of the cosmos yet to explore. Instead of an outward exploration of the cosmos, this is by far another philosophical approach with is rather maintained
inward. The reduction in cost of manufacturing high performance computers has enable international research effort to sequence and map collectively genes 
(genome) of members of respective species Homo sapiens. The benefit is evident in enabling doctors and health care providers to taylor care specifically
to people''s genetic makeup. Thanks to the advancement of the digital and information revolution :p.


				   ## Ubiquitous Computing

  Electrical/computing engineering where user''s interact with computers in different forms or hardware embedded in multiple forms of embedded systems. 
Embedded systems architecture can be seen in different forms such as wearable technology in the form of glasses (google glass), watches(samsung gear fit), 
or even NordicTrack iFit for monitoring heart pulses. Although, these technologies could be considered as pervasive when applied in a malicious sense 
depending on the outcome of application, they can also be used in enabling the safety of others with the right intent :p.


					  ## Power Wall

  Every economist will agree that nothing goes on forever, so here we have it the power wall. Hence, we can''t keep shrinking the size of transistors
forever just to create more logic gates to fit inside of integrated circuitry in order to increase computer performance. Note that transistors can''t be 
reduced to the size of atoms. Also something else to note is that, there is always leakeage of power consumption by transistors, eventually the consumption
of power grows exponentially with the increased number of transistors within a single core. Causing overheating and not very practically useful because 
with law of themodynamics, heat energy produced can disable some circuitry within the system :p.
 
  Hence, what do we? Well, hardware alone wouldn''t save the day however, we could combine multiple discplines in better algorithm design on the 
software abstraction level. We could also explore more areas in Performance via Parallelism (allowing multiple instructions set to operate in parallel) 
rather than waiting for previous operation to finish its execution cycle. Another way to optimize performance will also be to improve methods in 
Pipelining ( just like an assembly line), similar operations been performed at the same time to reduce clock cycles within the cpu. Finally, I hate to 
say this but sometimes it works, with better data mining techniques, we can also optimize systems with better predictions. This is because for alot of 
deterministic finite state machines, the outcome is always predictable. Rather than waiting for an operation to complete its execution in order to use
it''s output for the next operation, we could just predict the outcome of the previous operation and use it for the next operation to save both time 
and energy :p.
